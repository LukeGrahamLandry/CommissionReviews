## Luke's Minecraft Mod Commissions Reviews

For more info about commissioning mods: [moddingtutorials.org/commissions](https://moddingtutorials.org/commissions).  

The [issues tab](https://github.com/LukeGrahamLandryMC/CommissionReviews/issues) contains reviews of my services from past clients.  

Clients with a finished project that want to add a review should [create a new issue](https://github.com/LukeGrahamLandryMC/CommissionReviews/issues/new). I don't have a specific format for them, just tell people about your experience commissioning a mod and how I did. Perhaps include a brief description of what I did for you (and a link to the mod if it was released publicly). If you're a repeat customer that wants to add a review for another project, I'd ask that you add a comment to your existing issue rather than creating a new one.  

Thanks!
